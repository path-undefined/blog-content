        "en": "After I had visited the Museum of Applied Art Cologne, I went down along different streets randomly. At last I've stopped at an avenue in the campus of University of Cologne, there I sat down on a bench for a rest. After a while, a man came and started to play guitar. I like his style very much, thus I approached him and started to talk with him. Later I subscribbed his channle on YouTube. Few days aog, he published a new piece of remix work in his channel, which inspired me a lot. So I tried to remix his remix, and the result was amazingly good to me.",
