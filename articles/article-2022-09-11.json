To be very honest, after I had bought this car, I regretted it. Not only because this model has a lot of design problems, but also it was messed up by the pre-owner, thus it doesn't worth the price at all. Theoretically I could sell it as-is. However, since it was my first owned car in my life, it is an emotional piece. I hated it but also loved it. Thus it is hard for me to simply sell it. But then I thought, \"why not just use this car as a platform to learn the renovation and repairing of the car?\" Well, yes, at the end, I decided to start a project, to renovate the car.",

Yeah, I can understand, some people just want to share, well, the ultra-bass part of their favourite music on the street with other drivers. I told the pre-owner before the handover of the car, please please please remove the subwoofer in the trunk, and he did so, but had also managed to break the main speaker behind the door panel, and left a head unit of the audio system in the car which doesn't match the other interior parts at all. My favourite music genre is Jazz and some ambient, minimalist electronic music. Sound quality is not my main concern, but I do need bluetooth, so that I could play music with my smartphone while driving. Besides, I liked the original style of the interior of this car. So I decided to redo the audio system of the car completely, by restoring it to its original status, and adding a bluetooth module onto it.",

But no matter how hard I try, the antenna plug just refused to be plugged into the socket. I looked it carefully once again, crap... The antenna was adapter on adapter previously.

I grabbed a screw driver and removed it, and tried to find the same thing online, but without any luck. But an idea then suddenly came to my mind. The socket on the adapter is compatible with the antenna cable, and the metal contact points for the antenna cables were still there in the head unit. Maybe I could reuse the socket on the adapter, and solder it onto those metal contact points? Thus I picked up the tools again, and completely dissambled the head unit, soldered the socket to the head unit, and tried it on the car. It worked!

Watching those interior trims on the ground, in bright white and green, close to perfect, \"they are so lovely\", so I think. Suddenly I wanted to lick them, somehow. However, I have to disappoint you here. No, I didn't lick it, I inhibited those weird impulses",

Since I've repaired its audio system, painted the interior trims, replaced quite a few aged exterior parts, it looks even newer than the time when I bought it, which makes me love it even more. Now I'm starting to consider what else I could do for it. Maybe a new suspension? Or a new set of breaks? Or maybe even update the engine? Who knows, let's see!",
        "zh": "现在我不后悔买这辆车了。我修好了它的音响，翻新了它的内饰，车身外部又换掉了不少老化的零件。现在这辆车看起来比刚刚买来的时候还要新了，这让我渐渐地变得更喜欢它了。下一步只要把门板背后的固定点修好，然后把门板装上去，这次的翻新工作就大功告成啦。我现在已经开始考虑要不要为它再做点别的什么事情了。比如说我可以换一套悬挂，或者是换一套刹车，没准还能升级一下发动机呢。走一步看一步吧！"
