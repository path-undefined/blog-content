One day, after had a decent lunch at a very traditional restaurant \"Mar Stark\", I went to the Museum of Applied Art Cologne. I enjoyed the permanent exhibition there, which could be described as a brief history of the modern industrial design.",

        "en": "His guitar playing style was in the direction to post rock or ambient, which I liked quite a lot. And his remix work on YouTube was mostly slowed down, delayed and pitch dropped version of other songs. This technique worked very well on a piece called \"Inpeace\" by Sewerslvt, because it stretches the tempo, and keeps the deep pad sound, creates a very relaxed feeling. I'm a huge fan of deep, minimalistic music, for they make people thinking a lot and meditating a lot. After I heard his remix work, I suddenly noticed that if I add some groovy bass, techno-like bass drum, and some other sound effects based on his remix, it could be an interesting song into the ambient house direction.",
        "zh": "他弹吉他的风格应该属于后摇或者是氛围乐哪一类，我非常喜欢那种风格。他在YouTube频道里的作品大多数都是把别人的曲子拿来减慢速度、添加延迟，然后还降低音高做出来的。这个技法用在这首Sewerslvt作的《Inpeace》上面相当合适，因为它让原曲的节奏松弛下来了，但是没有改变原曲深邃的背景音色，从而营造了一种非常放松的感觉。总的来说我就是非常喜欢那种深邃的、极简主义风格的音乐的，因为它们往往能让人陷入深深的沉思，或者让人进入冥想的状态。我听完了他的remix作品之后，我突然意识到，如果我能在他的remix基础之上添加一些动感的贝斯、再加上类似于techno那种感觉的底鼓，最后再来一点其他的音效，恐怕就是一首类似于ambient house风格的音乐作品了。"

I just did what I could do, picking up the loop from the original work, which in my opinion fits the ambient feeling the best; selecting the sound I liked the most from the default library, and then arranging them carefully into the loop, trying not to fill up the song too much, so that the sparseness for the ambient feeling wasn't being broken; and finally turn some knobs to create some dynamic. It was simply done like this.",
        "zh": "我没多想就开工实现我的点子去了。我的remix技巧实话说跟“初学者级别”也差不了多少。我就是把我能做的事情都做了——首先我从原曲里面选了最适合循环的一段，在我看来这一段对那种ambient的感觉来说最适合不过了；然后我从默认的音色库里面选了几个我最喜欢的银色出来，然后小心翼翼地把它们安排到循环里面去，我不想把曲子填得“太满”，因为我不想破坏ambient风格里面那种“稀疏”的感觉；最后我随便拧了几个旋钮，营造了一点动态的效果。这样这首曲子就算是完成了。"

        "en": "I came up with the name of the song very easily too. The first time when I heard the original remix work, it felt just like walking in the blue ice cave. It's cold, and the sound texture feels like the sunlight going through the huge ice, creating blue and white spots. So I called it \"Cave\" at the beginning. But after that, I noticed that I had got the tempo wrong, instead of 115 bpm, it should be 114.84 bpm. So I saved the project with its original name \"Cave\" and its new tempo as a suffix, and then it was \"Cave 114.84\". Later, I thought that the number 114.84 makes it a little bit more \"techno-ish\", so I decided to keep it.",
        "zh": "给这首曲子起名字的时候也没费多少功夫。我第一次听到原来的remix作品的时候，它给我的感觉就好像是漫步在蓝冰洞中一般。曲子感觉非常冷，那些音色给人的感觉就像是阳光穿过了厚厚的冰层，然后在冰面上形成蓝色和白色的光斑。所以我一开始叫这首曲子《Cave》。后来，我发现我把曲子的速度搞错了，不应该是115bpm，而应该是114.84bpm。我改了速度之后，把工程另存为了一下，在原来的名字“Cave”后面加上了新的速度——114.84——作为后缀，于是它就成了《Cave 114.84》。后来我觉得114.84这个数字好像给这首曲子加了一丁点“techno”的感觉，所以我就决定留着这个名字了。"

Since at the end it was his work, I should share it with him. So I created a video, using a black-white photo that I had taken several months ago as the picture, and put the new remixed song as the backgound music. I left a comment under his video after I had uploaded mine, notifying him that I've remixed his work, and I really hope that he could like it.",

I've got another piece of music already, which is called \"Geysir\", produced about a year ago by myself. Both of them feels like the landscape in Iceland. So I uploaded that song too, with the same picture. My goal was not to finish the album within a blabla time. I just wanted to have a place to collect all of my produced songs, and that's it.",

I tried to learn something everyday, and if I wasn't improving myself, I would be very upset, and felt like wasting my time. Soon after that, I noticed that I wasn't doing any creative work, instead, I was trying to prove and improve myself meaninglessly, which was very stressful and toxic.",

It is just a natural way of expressing myself. If I have inspiration, then I do something about it. If I don't, then I do something else. In such a way, I can enjoy myself while doing music, without worrying about not able to proving myself, without worrying about not improving myself. That is exactly the attitude and inner peace that I have looked after for years, and now it finally comes to me.",
