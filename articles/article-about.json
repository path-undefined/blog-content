It might be the ticks from a clock on the wall, or the oscillation of a quartz crystal, or even the radiation generated by the electron transition of the caesium 133 atom. But these are all mechanic, these are all artificially invented or defined for meassurement of the time. However, we all know the concept of time even before there is any clock on the wall. So the question is rather, what is _time to me_?",

They just happens. Since I don't remember anything, I won't know any connection between them, I won't even know the current change is happening after another.
