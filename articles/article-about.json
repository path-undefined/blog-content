At first, I've just learnt some C++, and the most complex program that I could do was a command line program with most of the code copied from a textbook. I've never thought about that in the following years, I've written more and more programs, and they were becoming more and more complex. In the summer vacation after I've graduated from the senior high school, I've written a plugin for the game called \"Live for Speed\", which is also the first time I've understood what programming really is. Soon after that, I've written a little game. My plan was to build a game about turrets shooting asteroids. In the middle of the screen there is a turret, which has a mass. And the asteroids will fly into the screen, and fly towards the turret according to the law of universal graviation. The play have to control the turret to shoot those asteroids, otherwise they will hit the turret and it will be a Game Over. My code of the game was a huge mess, there were more than 200 errors occuring in the first compilation. I were so patient that I've correct them one by one. And once the program was getting running, then several memory errors came up, all sorts of \"segmentation fault\". I had no single idea what that meant. With some painful struggles, I've managed to make the program \"segmentation fault\" free. And then bugs were following. The bullet of turrets missed, but the asteroids were getting destroyed. And the asteroid missed the turret, but it was a Game Over. These bugs has drained the last patience from me for this program, thus the game was never finished.",

However just like most of the beginner programmers, I had a certain \"optimism\" (according to Uncle Bob, the author of the \"Clean Code\") at that time. I was thinking no matter how big the project is, to finish it is just a matter of time for me. For countless times I've tried to finish a decent game project, but other than those simple ones like Tetris, Galaxy Attack or Snake, I've never managed to finish one single project more complex than those.

However Mechanic Engineering is nothing about practice, it is more about calculating and drawing blueprints. I couldn't accept the fact that I don't have to get my hands dirty to study Mechanic Engineering. So after several stuggles in my head, I've changed my subject to Informatics (equivalent to Computer Science). After I've changed my subject, I felt just like the duck in the water. Having studied one thing or two about Mechanic Engineering, I still didn't have the necessary tools or machines to help me produce a gearbox.

In the 1st semester I've managed to pass several exams in the 3rd semester, and then in the 2nd semester those in the 4th semester. No matter what I've learnt in the courses, I wouldn't be satisfied until I really tried them by myself. Although I've got some problem with my Bachelor Thesis, which delayed the time of my graduation, I've managed to finish a lot of small projects with in the four years of studying.

Since the companies seem to be fond of the candidates who have a solid theoretical knowledge basis, while having plenty of practical experiences too. I was starting from Java back-end developer, slowly moved to full-stack, and then front-end developer. A lot of people can't understand till now, why I was moving from a \"high-level\" work to a \"low-level\" work. I was thinking exactly the opposite. First, the back-end services are communicating with computers, even if there is an event-bus, those requests, response and events are all well organized, they come and go, one after another, no one cares about what is happening in between, which makes it just like a \"turn-based\" game. While in the front-end world, human-being users always have the talent to crash a front-end app within 5 minutes, since human-beings are not computer: they don't like following rules; they don't do one thing after another, instead, they will slap the mouse on their desks with dirty words out of their mouths and waiting for the results shown on the UI. Thus, the front-end application is more like a \"real-time\" game. Besides, the back-end service runs as if it has all the resources in the machine, however in the front-end, there is no \"other machine\" to take care of other tasks. The business logic part have to be swift, so that the smooth user interactions are guranteed, which makes the performance optimization much harder. Moreover, the back-end services usually get their ideal running environment, while the front-end apps are basically stuck with in a virtual machine which is called \"user agent\", or better, \"browser\", one has to work with whatever available, and different browser vendors are even making the development more bumpy. But I am a person who loves challenge, and front-end development is challenging for me, which is exactly the reason why I've moved to front-end development.",

No matter whether it is front-end, back-end, IoT, compiler, operating system, big data, or even AI, at last, they are answering four questions: how to store/represent data; how to gather data; how to operate with/process data; and how to publish data. Actually these four questions are also the core questions of Informatics. Once the term \"programming\" is being mentioned, my brain will start automatically to sort all the different details, organize them, and then come up with the answers of the four questions.

Every part of the car can be customized, bumpers, head lights, body colors, decals, spoilers, rims, engines, transmissions, suspensions, tires, even the underbody neons, as long as one can think of. One can even put the cars on a dyno, fine tuning the ECU, or drive the car in a track to tune the suspension. I were already fond of cars before, and the game was like a huge magnet, kept pulling me towards it. I've never thought about that the cars in the real life could also be modified and tuned until it is perfect to me. From then on, I were attracted by the modified cars. I subscribbed several different car magazines. My favourite column at that time was obviously car modifications. I kept reading those magazines until senior high school. In my senior high school time, I got to know another game called \"Live for Speed\", which is a serious car racing simulator, where all the factors are modelled according to the real car physics. The number of modifiable parameters of a car in this game are amazingly big. Different angles of the suspensions, tire pressures, transmission ratios, LSD, all can be fine tuned in the game. I were obsessed by this game for a very long time, and I've learnt a lot about car dynamics from the game. At my senior high school age, my dream job was to be a car designer.
