I thought it was a cat at the beginning, but it turned out to be a little fox. I dragged out my camera immediately and try to catch it on photos. Although the lens is reaching its limit, but the small creature on the picture is still very blurry. I tried to reach the little fox slowly; however the fox noticed me and quickly jumped away. What a pitty! I'll definitely need a telescope lens if I want to do some serious bird or wildlife shooting in the future.",
